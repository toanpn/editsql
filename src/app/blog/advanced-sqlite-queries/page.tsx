          <p className="lead">
            SQLite&apos;s analytical capabilities extend far beyond basic SELECT statements. With window functions, common table expressions, and advanced SQL techniques, you can perform sophisticated data analysis directly in SQLite. This guide explores powerful query patterns that will transform how you analyze data.
          </p>
          
          <h2 id="window-functions">1. Window Functions - Your Analysis Powerhouse</h2>
          <p>
            Window functions allow you to perform calculations across related rows without grouping them. They&apos;re perfect for rankings, running totals, and comparative analysis.
          </p>
          
          <h3>Ranking and Row Numbers</h3>
          <pre className="language-sql">
            <code>
{`-- Rank employees by salary within each department
SELECT 
    name,
    department,
    salary,
    RANK() OVER (PARTITION BY department ORDER BY salary DESC) as salary_rank,
    ROW_NUMBER() OVER (PARTITION BY department ORDER BY salary DESC) as row_num,
    DENSE_RANK() OVER (PARTITION BY department ORDER BY salary DESC) as dense_rank
FROM employees;

-- Find top 3 performers in each region
SELECT * FROM (
    SELECT 
        employee_id,
        region,
        performance_score,
        ROW_NUMBER() OVER (PARTITION BY region ORDER BY performance_score DESC) as rank
    FROM employee_performance
) ranked
WHERE rank <= 3;`}
            </code>
          </pre>
          
          <h3>Running Totals and Moving Averages</h3>
          <pre className="language-sql">
            <code>
{`-- Calculate running total of daily sales
SELECT 
    date,
    daily_sales,
    SUM(daily_sales) OVER (
        ORDER BY date 
        ROWS BETWEEN UNBOUNDED PRECEDING AND CURRENT ROW
    ) as running_total,
    AVG(daily_sales) OVER (
        ORDER BY date 
        ROWS BETWEEN 6 PRECEDING AND CURRENT ROW
    ) as seven_day_avg
FROM daily_sales
ORDER BY date;

-- Year-over-year growth comparison
SELECT 
    year,
    month,
    revenue,
    LAG(revenue, 12) OVER (ORDER BY year, month) as prev_year_revenue,
    ROUND(
        (revenue - LAG(revenue, 12) OVER (ORDER BY year, month)) * 100.0 / 
        LAG(revenue, 12) OVER (ORDER BY year, month), 2
    ) as yoy_growth_percent
FROM monthly_revenue
ORDER BY year, month;`}
            </code>
          </pre>
          
          <h2 id="cte-queries">2. Common Table Expressions (CTEs)</h2>
          <p>
            CTEs make complex queries readable and maintainable by breaking them into logical steps.
          </p>
          
          <h3>Recursive CTEs for Hierarchical Data</h3>
          <pre className="language-sql">
            <code>

          <h2 id="json-operations">3. JSON Data Analysis</h2>
          <p>
            SQLite&apos;s JSON functions enable you to work with semi-structured data directly in SQL.
          </p>
          
          <h3>Extracting JSON Data</h3>
          <pre className="language-sql">
