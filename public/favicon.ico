This file should be replaced with a real .ico file generated from the icon.svg file. Since ICO is a binary format, please convert the SVG to ICO using a tool like:

1. ImageMagick
2. Online favicon generators
3. Graphics software that supports ICO output

The ICO file should contain multiple resolutions (16x16, 32x32, 48x48) for best compatibility.
