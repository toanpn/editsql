## 🔧 Rationale for Choices

### 🧠 Programming Paradigm: *Mixed (Functional + Event-Driven)*  
**Why**: React’s component-based architecture and hooks encourage functional paradigms, while user actions (upload, edit, export) naturally fit event-driven workflows.

### 🌐 Language: *TypeScript (React + Next.js)*  
**Why**: Type safety is critical for catching errors in data manipulation (especially when handling dynamic SQLite schemas).

### 📚 Project Type: *Web Development*  
**Why**: This is a web-based SPA (Single Page Application) with API backends.

### 📖 Comment Style: *Descriptive + Inline*  
**Why**: Complex interactions (editing, SQL parsing, file handling) benefit from clear, maintainable code comments.

### 🛠 Code Structure: *Modular*  
**Why**: API routes, UI components, and SQLite logic are cleanly separated for easy scaling.

### 🚫 Error Handling: *Robust + Contextual*  
**Why**: Users expect precise feedback when working with databases (e.g., SQL errors, file issues).

### ⚡ Performance: *Medium + Scalability Focus*  
**Why**: 10MB files are light, but handling queries and real-time editing requires thoughtful performance.

## 🔮 Notes for Future Phases

- **Account/User system** for persistent file storage.
- **Bigger file size limits** for premium tiers.
- **Versioning & undo/redo support**.
- **SQL autocomplete**.
